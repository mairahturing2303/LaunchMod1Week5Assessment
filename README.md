# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?
Your variable would not be accessible in the way you need and you would need to debug in order to bring the variable back into the range of accessibility
2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A - arrange 
A -   act 
A -   assert

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?
Public can be viewed from any tab in your program and as well as used in any part of the program. Private is going to mean that the modifer only has accessibility in certain parts of the program. 
4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
(A) Make changes to an object  
(B) Return some information about an object  
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object.  
(D) None of the Above.  
(A) (B) but its not required for both to happen for it to be a method

5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?

I used my notes, and the lesson plans.
## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
* DM a link to your forked repository to your instructors
